Logic of code:

1. Define a function called palindrome that takes one argument called word.
2. Check the data type of word. It should be a string:
â€“ Otherwise, raise an error.
1. If the string is empty:
â€“ Return None.
1. Convert the word to lowercase.
2. Set two pointers: one at the start called left, and one at the end called right.
3. While left is less than right, start a loop:
â€“ If the characters at left and right are not equal:
â€“ Return False.
â€“ Otherwise, increment left and decrement right.
1. Return True if all characters matched.



The time complexity of the pointer solution is:

ðŸ‘‰ O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Because:

You check each character once from both ends using left and right.
The space complexity is:

ðŸ‘‰ O(1), because you use only a few variables (left, right, etc.), no extra memory that grows with input.
